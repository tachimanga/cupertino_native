# Liquid Glass for Flutter

Native Liquid Glass widgets for iOS and macOS in Flutter with pixelâ€‘perfect fidelity.

This plugin hosts real UIKit/AppKit controls inside Flutter using Platform Views and method channels. It matches native look/feel perfectly while still fitting naturally into Flutter code.

Does it work and is it fast? Yes. Is it a vibe-coded Frankenstein's monster patched together with duct tape? Also yes.

This package is a proof of concept for bringing Liquid Glass to Flutter. Contributions are most welcome. What we have here can serve as a great starting point for building a complete, polished library. The vision for this package is to bridge the gap until we have a good, new Cupertino library written entirely in Flutter. To move toward completeness, we can also improve parts that are easy to write in Flutter to match the new Liquid Glass style (e.g., improved `CupertinoScaffold`, theme, etc.).

Read the release blogpost: ðŸ‘‰ [Is it time for Flutter to leave the uncanny valley?](https://medium.com/serverpod/is-it-time-for-flutter-to-leave-the-uncanny-valley-b7f2cdb834ae)

## Installation

Add the dependency in your appâ€™s `pubspec.yaml`:

```bash
flutter pub add cupertino_native
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

Ensure your platform minimums are compatible:

- iOS `platform :ios, '14.0'`
- macOS 11.0+

You will also need to install the Xcode 26 beta and use `xcode-select` to set it as your default.

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app
```

## What's in the package

This package ships a handful of native Liquid Glass widgets. Each widget exposes a simple, Flutterâ€‘friendly API and falls back to a reasonable Flutter implementation on nonâ€‘Apple platforms.

### Slider

![Liquid Glass Slider](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/slider.png)

```dart
double _value = 50;

CNSlider(
  value: _value,
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  onChanged: (v) => setState(() => _value = v),
)
```

### Switch

![Liquid Glass Switch](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/switch.png)

```dart
bool _on = true;

CNSwitch(
  value: _on,
  onChanged: (v) => setState(() => _on = v),
)
```

### Segmented Control

![Liquid Glass Segmented Control](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/segmented-control.png)

```dart
int _index = 0;

CNSegmentedControl(
  labels: const ['One', 'Two', 'Three'],
  selectedIndex: _index,
  onValueChanged: (i) => setState(() => _index = i),
)
```

### Button

![Liquid Glass Button](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/button.png)

```dart
CNButton(
  label: 'Press me',
  onPressed: () {},
)

// Icon button variant
CNButton.icon(
  icon: const CNSymbol('heart.fill'),
  onPressed: () {},
)

// Button with child variant
CNButton.child(
  child: Container(
    child: Text("Press me"),
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
)
```

### Icon (SF Symbols)

![Liquid Glass Icon](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/icon.png)

```dart
// Monochrome symbol
const CNIcon(symbol: CNSymbol('star'));

// Multicolor / hierarchical options are also supported
const CNIcon(
  symbol: CNSymbol('paintpalette.fill'),
  mode: CNSymbolRenderingMode.multicolor,
)
```

### Popup Menu Button

![Liquid Glass Popup Menu Button](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/popup-menu-button.png)

```dart
final items = [
  const CNPopupMenuItem(label: 'New File', icon: CNSymbol('doc', size: 18)),
  const CNPopupMenuItem(label: 'New Folder', icon: CNSymbol('folder', size: 18)),
  const CNPopupMenuDivider(),
  const CNPopupMenuItem(label: 'Rename', icon: CNSymbol('rectangle.and.pencil.and.ellipsis', size: 18)),
];

CNPopupMenuButton(
  buttonLabel: 'Actions',
  items: items,
  onSelected: (int index, CNPopupMenuItem<T> entry) {
    // Handle selection
  },
)
```

### Tab Bar

![Liquid Glass Tab Bar](https://github.com/serverpod/cupertino_native/raw/main/misc/screenshots/tab-bar.png)

```dart
int _tabIndex = 0;

// Overlay this at the bottom of your page
CNTabBar(
  items: const [
    CNTabBarItem(label: 'Home', icon: CNSymbol('house.fill'), badge: '3'),
    CNTabBarItem(label: 'Profile', icon: CNSymbol('person.crop.circle')),
    CNTabBarItem(label: 'Settings', icon: CNSymbol('gearshape.fill'), badge: '!'),
  ],
  currentIndex: _tabIndex,
  onTap: (i) => setState(() => _tabIndex = i),
)
```

### Alert Dialog

```dart
CNAlertDialog.show(
  context: context,
  title: 'Delete Item',
  message: 'Are you sure you want to delete this item? This action cannot be undone.',
  actions: [
    CNAlertAction(
      title: 'Cancel',
      style: CNAlertActionStyle.cancel,
      onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
    ),
    CNAlertAction(
      title: 'Delete',
      style: CNAlertActionStyle.destructive,
      onPressed: () {
        // Handle deletion
        Navigator.pop(context);
      },
    ),
  ],
  icon: const CNSymbol('trash.fill', size: 24, color: Colors.red),
);

// Multiple action styles supported:
// - defaultAction, cancel, destructive  
// - primary, secondary, success, warning, info, disabled
// - Uses borderedProminent style by default
// - Automatic dark mode adaptation
// - SF Symbol icon support with multiple rendering modes
```

## What's left to do?
So far, this is more of a proof of concept than a full package (although the included components do work). Future improvements include:

- Cleaning up the code. Probably by someone who knows a bit about Swift.
- Adding more native components.
- Reviewing the Flutter APIs to ensure consistency and eliminate redundancies.
- Extending the flexibility and styling options of the widgets.
- Investigate how to best combine scroll views with the native components.
- macOS compiles and runs, but it's untested with Liquid Glass and generally doesn't look great.

## How was this done?
Pretty much vibe-coded with Codex and GPT-5. ðŸ˜…
